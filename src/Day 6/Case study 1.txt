Case Study: Telecom Service Management
You are required to design a telecom service management system. This system should manage different types of telecom services, such as prepaid and postpaid plans, using object-oriented programming concepts. Implement the following requirements:

1. Abstract Class: TelecomService
- Define an abstract class named TelecomService with the following private instance variables:
- serviceName (String)
- serviceCost (double)
- serviceDuration (int) - in days
- Include a parameterized constructor to initialize these fields.
- Include abstract methods:
- calculateTotalCost(): Calculate the total cost of the service based on the duration and any additional charges.
- getServiceDetails(): Return the details of the service.
- Include a concrete method applyDiscount(double discountPercentage) to reduce the serviceCost by the given discount percentage.

2. Interface: Renewable
- Define an interface Renewable with the following method:
- renewService(int additionalDays): Adds the given number of days to the service duration.

3. Concrete Classes:
Class PrepaidService:
- Extend TelecomService and implement the Renewable interface.
- Include a private instance variable dataBalance (in GB).
- Implement the calculateTotalCost() method, where the total cost is the serviceCost multiplied by the serviceDuration. If the dataBalance falls below 1 GB, a surcharge of $10 is added.
- Implement the getServiceDetails() method to return a string with service details including data balance.
- Implement the renewService(int additionalDays) method to extend the service duration.

Class PostpaidService:
- Extend TelecomService and implement the Renewable interface.
- Include a private instance variable monthlyLimit (in GB).
- Implement the calculateTotalCost() method, where the total cost is the serviceCost plus an additional $20 if the usage exceeds monthlyLimit.
- Implement the getServiceDetails() method to return a string with service details including monthly limit.
- Implement the renewService(int additionalDays) method to extend the service duration.

4. Test Class:
- Create a TestTelecomService class with a main method to test the functionality of both PrepaidService and PostpaidService.
- Create objects for both classes, calculate the total cost, apply a discount, renew the service, and display the service details before and after renewal.
